# I did not pick them they picked me

* Bash
* Python
* Rust
* Scala
* Terraform
* TypeScript

The **Bourne shell** was cutting edge in 1977, and it still is today. I have aesthetics issues with it, but it has found a new happy home in cloud computing.

**Python** and **Scala** will take you far in backend and data engineering.

The gradual types in Python 3.6 and 3.7 are really a great help but they are very simple compared to TypeScript that probably has the most sophisticated type system these days.

**Rust** is beginning to make it into cloud infrastructure

* AWS Firecracker
* Fargate
* Google Fuchsia

Rust also seems like a natural choice for working with WebAssembly.

**Terraform** feels like a strange combination of Haskell and TypeSafe config. But it also fills a niche in cloud computing for: Infrastructure as code.

**TypeScript** is a roubust JavaScript and unsurpassed at describing and processing complex syntactic relations using its type system.
