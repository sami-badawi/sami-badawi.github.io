    <h1>Will A.I. Think in Logic or English</h1>
<p>We have seen a lot of progress in A.I. during 2023. Every week something new has happened.</p>
<p>ChatGPT is probably the most famous example. It is a chatbot that can talk about anything and generate code.</p>
<p>I started studying A.I. during the symbolic A.I. era, and assumed that when A.I. started producing results it would eventually think in logic.
ChatGPT is a big black box consisting of billions of parameters. Trained on a huge corpus of text, by hiding a word and asking the model to predict the missing word. So the opposite of logic.</p>
<p>While this is impressive it is hard to extract business value from this. I see two ways forward for LLMs in the near future.</p>
<ul>
<li>Return of Symbolic Logic</li>
<li>Chat is All You Need</li>
</ul>
<h1>Return of Symbolic Logic</h1>
<p>We find a way to translate the result from large language models into logic, say RDF, OWL or a knowledge graph.
This is a good medium for storing large amounts of knowledge in a form that you can query and reason about.</p>
<h1>Chat is All You Need</h1>
<p>It is also possible that LLMs will reinvent some rudimentary form of logic, and that you will just be able to ask it questions.</p>
<p>This seems like a brittle way to represent larger amounts of knowledge. In that case we would have invented a weird new form of ad hoc intelligence, that knows how to chat but is hard to reason about or have confidence in.</p>
