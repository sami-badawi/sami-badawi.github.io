    <h1>Many languages are converging on a common feature set</h1>
<p>I love languages and every language has some great features, but also some very annoying ones.
Python and Scala were the first languages where I felt that the good parts overshadow the bad parts. They really improved my productivity.</p>
<p>In 2023 most mainstream languages have adapted successful ideas from other languages. And they have all become pretty good.</p>
<h1>Language I have used in early 2023</h1>
<ul>
<li>Bash</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Rust</li>
<li>Scala</li>
<li>TypeScript</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bourne shell</h2>
<p>I have been using Bourne shell for writing scripts and cloud work.</p>
<h2>Python</h2>
<p>I have been using Python for doing ML / A.I. and for writing api.</p>
<h2>Rust</h2>
<p>I have been using Rust for serving PyTorch models.</p>
<h2>Scala</h2>
<p>I have been using Scala for writing data pipelines in Flink.</p>
<h2>TypeScript</h2>
<p>I think that TypeScript has the most powerful type system of all mainstream languages.
But last I used it, getting the tooling working was still too much work.</p>
<p>Now both Deno and Bun.sh have TypeScript support out of the box.
I have been using TypeScript for handling json and for doing a little front end work using Deno libraries.</p>
<h1>Language I would like to use more</h1>
<h2>C#</h2>
<p>.NET is a great platform and C# is a great language, for GUI work this is my first choice.</p>
<h2>Lean 4</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4">Lean 4</a> is a proof assistant and a Haskell-like functional programming language. It is based on dependent types and has a very powerful type system.</p>
<p>Mathematicians are using Lean 4 to prove theorems.</p>
<p>Lean 4 has fixed some of the warts in Haskell, and I think that the combination of theorem prover and a functional programming language could prove useful for A.I. applications.</p>
<h2>Nim</h2>
<p>I tried Nim last year and I was impressed. It looked a lot like Python and it was fast like C.
However the library support is still limited. Nim shows that you do not have to choose between fast and simple.</p>
<h2>Zig</h2>
<p>Zig is a new generation of systems programming language. It is a lot like C, but with a much better type system.</p>
<p>It is also a build system that you can compile C and C++ code with.
You write your build script in Zig and not in CMake, this gives it a lot of power.</p>
<p>I tried the Ziglang game engine, <a href="https://machengine.org">Mach engine</a>. Mach Engine ships with several cross platform 2D and 3D demos, which compiled and ran in seconds.</p>
<p>Getting 2D and 3D demos running in C++ took me many long weekends between learning and configuring CMake, vcpkg, GLFW, GLEW and OpenGL.</p>
