# Port of my static site from Hugo to Lume base blog

My static site [sami.badawi.com](http://sami.badawi.com) is now generated by Hugo and hosted on Google Cloud Storage.

Trying out Lume hosted on GitHub Pages, run with GitHub Actions.

Currently there css is very bad.

## Lume base blog

A starter repository showing how to build a blog with the
[Lume](https://github.com/lumeland/lume) static site generator.

This project started as a fork of
[eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) but adapted to
Lume and with the NetlifyCMS.
