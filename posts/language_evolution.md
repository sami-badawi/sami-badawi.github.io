# Languages Evolution with Poetic License

Looking at language everlution over many years I lost count of how many times I feel in love with a new language and thought this was the untimate language.

Here are my initial impressions for some mainstream languages that I really liked:

## C++
The one true programming language of the day.
With the awesome power of OOP.

## Java
The untimate language to end all languages.
It had everything that was cool in 1994.

## C#
The perfect language that cleaned up everything that went wrong in Java.

## Perl
They lied to me!

You don’t need design patterms and OOP.

You can hack it out in 10 lines of Perl.

## Python
Hey you don’t need to hack it out in 10 lines of Perl.
You can program it in 15 lines of Python.

## Scala
Theoretical CS and type theory is not just for academia.
A gem of a orthogonal, minimal constructs.
Safe, elegant, fast and happy.

## Haskell
Wow it is possible to program in mathematics. I did it! I scaled mount Haskell and took a snapshot and wrote a blog post.

## TypeScript
You do not have to chose between type based language and dynamic data language.
You can have both.

## Rust
At a low level the computer industry is build on a very insecure foundation.
Type theory can make lowlevel code very fast, safe and elegant.
